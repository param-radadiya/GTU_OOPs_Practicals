# GTU_OOPs_Practicals
For GTU student, practicles of subject Object Oriented Programming in JAVA(3140705) are available.

The list of practical is

Added :

1) Write a Program that displays Welcome to Java, Learning Java Now and Programming is fun.

2)Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value x and y:
   -> 3.4x+50.2y=44.5 
   -> 2.1x+.55y=5.9 (Assume Cramer’s rule to solve equation
   ax+by=e x=ed-bf/ad-bc
   cx+dy=f y=af-ec/ad-bc )

3) Write a program that reads a number in meters, converts it to feet, and displays the result.

4) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your
weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that
prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI.
Note:- 1 pound=.45359237 Kg and 1 inch=.0254 meters.

5) Write a program that prompts the user to enter three integers and display the integers in decreasing
order.

6) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a letter and check whether a letter is a vowel or
constant

7) Assume a vehicle plate number consists of three uppercase letters followed by four digits. Write a
program to generate a plate number.

8) Write a program that reads an integer and displays all its smallest factors in increasing order. For
example if input number is 120, the output should be as follows:2,2,2,3,5.

9) Write a method with following method header.
public static int gcd(int num1, int num2)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integers and compute the gcd of two integers.

10) Write a test program that prompts the user to enter ten numbers, invoke a method to reverse thenumbers, display the numbers.

11) Write a program that generate 6*6 two-dimensional matrix, filled with 0’s and 1’s , display thematrix, check every raw and column have an odd number’s of 1’s.

[extension] : Write a program that generate 6*6 two-dimensional matrix, filled with 0’s and 1’s , display the matrix, check every row and column has an odd number of 1’s. Array[6][6]  -- fill this with 0,1.
        Output: Status : Print matrix with status as True/False
        True : when ever raw and column have odd number of 1’s
        False: Invalid row at (return row num) at column(return column number)

12) Write a program that creates a Random object with seed 1000 and displays the first 100 random
integers between 1 and 49 using the NextInt (49) method. 

13) Write a program for calculator to accept an expression as a string in which the operands and
operator are separated by zero or more spaces.
For ex: 3+4 and 3 + 4 are acceptable expressions.

Remaining : (Will add soon...)

14) Write a program that creates an Array List and adds a Loan object , a Date object , a string, and a
Circle object to the list, and use a loop to display all elements in the list by invoking the object’s to
String() method.

15) Write the bin2Dec (string binary String) method to convert a binary string into a decimal number.
Implement the bin2Dec method to throw a NumberFormatException if the string is not a binary
string.

16) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a decimal number and displays the number in a
fraction.
Hint: Read the decimal number as a string, extract the integer part and fractional part from the
string.

17) Write a program that displays a tic-tac-toe board. A cell may be X, O, or empty. What to display at
each cell is randomly decided. The X and O are images in the files X.gif and O.gif.

18) Write a program that moves a circle up, down, left or right using arrow keys.

19) Write a program that displays the color of a circle as red when the mouse button is pressed and as
blue when the mouse button is released.

20) Write a GUI program that use button to move the message to the left and right and use the radio
button to change the color for the message displayed.

21) Write a program to create a file name 123.txt, if it does not exist. Append a new data to it if it
already exist. write 150 integers created randomly into the file using Text I/O. Integers are
separated by space.

22) Write a recursive method that returns the smallest integer in an array. Write a test program that
prompts the user to enter an integer and display its product.

23) Write a generic method that returns the minimum elements in a two dimensional array.

24) Define MYPriorityQueue class that extends Priority Queue to implement the Cloneable interface
and implement the clone() method to clone a priority queue.

25) Write a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the nonduplicate words in
descending order.The text file is passed as a command-line argument.
